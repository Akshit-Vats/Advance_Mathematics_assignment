📋 Project OverviewThis project involves performing a non-linear transformation on air quality data ($NO_2$ concentrations) using parameters derived from a University Roll Number. The goal is to "learn" the optimal parameters of a Probability Density Function (PDF) that fits the transformed data using Machine Learning/Estimation techniques.🛠 MethodologyThe project is executed in three distinct phases:Phase 1: Data Pre-processingDataset: India Air Quality Data (1990–2015).Feature Selection: $NO_2$ (Nitrogen Dioxide) levels are used as the primary feature ($x$).Cleaning: Handled missing values (NaN) using mean imputation and resolved character encoding issues (UTF-8/Latin-1) to ensure data integrity.Phase 2: Non-Linear TransformationWe transform the raw feature $x$ into a new variable $z$ using a sine-based non-linear function:$$z = T_r(x) = x + a_r \sin(b_r x)$$The behavior of this transformation is dictated by your University Roll Number ($r$):$a_r = 0.05 \times (r \pmod 7)$: Controls the amplitude of the non-linear "noise" or shift.$b_r = 0.3 \times (r \pmod 5 + 1)$: Controls the frequency of the oscillation applied to the data.Phase 3: Learning the PDF ModelWe define a model for the predicted probability $\hat{p}(z)$ based on a Gaussian-style distribution:$$\hat{p}(z) = c \cdot e^{-\lambda(z-\mu)^2}$$To "learn" the parameters ($\lambda, \mu, c$), we use Non-Linear Least Squares (NLLS). The algorithm iteratively minimizes the difference between the model and the actual histogram density of the data.$\mu$ (Mu): Learns the central tendency (mean) of the transformed data.$\lambda$ (Lambda): Learns the precision (inverse of variance) of the distribution.$c$: Learns the peak height to ensure the curve matches the density scale.
